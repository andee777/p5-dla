# Diffusion Limitation Agreggation
Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) is the process whereby particles undergoing a random walk due to Brownian motion cluster together to form aggregates of such particles. 

This is an implementation of DLA using the p5.js library. The example is taken from: https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/034-dla.html. This is link for the original paper that was used for this example: http://paulbourke.net/fractals/dla/.

My version of the demo can be accessed here: https://andee777.github.io/p5-dla/.
